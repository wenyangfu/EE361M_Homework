    "# Question 1 (1+1+5+3+3+2=15pts) - Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we will be predicting whether someone will have an affair! Yes - there is data on this. See below on how to import the data.\n",
    "1. Convert naffairs to a binary variable hadAffair which is 1 if had an affair and zero otherwise\n",
    "2. Split the data into training and test. Use 42 as random seed and use 1/3rd of the data for testing. Our y variable is hadAffair and X matrix includes all the other variables except naffairs.\n",
    "3. Train a logistic regression with almost no regularization (pass l2 (ridge) to penalty and 1,000 to the C parameter which is the inverse of regularization strength lambda. This essentially does l2 regularization but applies very little weight to the penalty term) and report the confusion matrix on the test data. Also report the accuracy for the \"no affairs\" class, the affairs class, and the average per-class accuracy on the test data. Average per-class accuracy is described in this [post](http://blog.dato.com/how-to-evaluate-machine-learning-models-part-2a-classification-metrics).\n",
    "4. Repeat step 3 except use l2 penalty with Cs of [.001, .01,0.1, 1]. You will want to use k-fold cross validation to select the best parameter. To evaluate which parameter is best, maximize the average per-class accuracy. To help with this task, check out [GridSearchCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and how to make your own [custom scorer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html).\n",
    "5. Repeat question 4 except use l1 (i.e. Lasso) instead of l2 as the penalty type.\n",
    "6. Which model produces the best average per-class accuracy? Why do you think this is the case? How do the models handle the different classes, and why is this so?"
